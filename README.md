# MDvsFA
PyTorch implementation of  ICCV2019 paper Miss Detection vs. False Alarm: Adversarial Learing for Small Object Segmentation in Infrared Images.

# Guide
1. Creating the following folders:
    - training_results: this folder is to contain all the images of evaluation phases, to visualize the performance of model
    - test_results: this folder is to contain the images during test phases
    - logs: this folder is to contain all logs during training
  
2. Using following command to train:
    ```python
      python train.py
    ```
    all the training parameters have default values
  
3. Using following command to test:
    ```python
      python test.py
    ```
